                <h1>Product Processing and Work flow</h1>
<br>Raw Material Preparation : To prepare the raw materials is the first thing when we make wood pellet. </br>
<br>Drying : For large wood pellet plants, after the initial size reduction step, the raw materials must be dried. In order to produce high quality wood pellets, the raw material must maintains a moisture content of 8% - 12%, so the raw material must be put into a dryer to reduce its moisture content. The most common dryer for large pellet plant is the rotary drum dryer, which is the most cost effective choice for large pellet plant.</br>
<br>Initial Sieving : After the drying process, the raw material will be sieved to separate the contaminants such as stone and metal particles away from the wood raw materials.</br>
<br>Grinding :  Have a function for a size reduction step to make wood pellet. </br>
<br>Pelletizing : The machine used to pelletize the raw materials into wood pellet is called pellet mill.</br>
<br>Cooling : To make the wood pellet regain its proper rigidity and temperature, the wood pellet will be fed into a pellet cooler right after the pelletizing process. </br>
<br>Final Sieving : At this stage, the wood pellet sieving purpose is different from the initial sieving.  After the pellet cooling process, the wood pellet products will be sieved in order to separate the fine particles from the well made wood pellet. For the final sieving process, the vibrating screen is a common equipment for wood pellet plant.</br>
