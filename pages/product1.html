                <h1>Best Quality Wood Pellet</h1>

                <p>Heat output: This is measured in BTUs, so you want to look for pellets that have higher BTU ratings. The best pellets are in the 8,000-8,500 range. It is important to note that you may see a “moisture free” label. This indicates the BTU rating when all the water is removed from the pellet. This rating is unrealistic,
                because you don’t store your pellets in a vacuum. If it is the only BTU rating available then aim for something between 8.2k to 8.8k BTUs.</p>

                <details><p>Low Moisture Content: This influences how long it takes you to light your pellet stove. If you use low moisture pellets as fuel it won’t take as long. The best pellets have a moisture content of 6.5% and below.
                <br>Low Ash Content: This describes how much ash is left over in proportion to how much wood was burned. Having a lot of ash produced will make your stove run less efficiency, so look for pellets that say “low ash content”.
                No additives or bark: Pellets without bark, cardboard, glue, or recycled materials burn hotter and produce less ash.</details></br></p>
